[{"pk": 1, "model": "tests.page", "fields": {"content": "Japan broke international convention and became the first of the world's largest, advanced economies in several years to intervene in currency markets Wednesday.\n\n\n\nUnilateral currency intervention, once a common tool among industrialized economies, fell out of favor in recent years, amid a perception that it was unfair to trading partners and ineffective over the long term.\n\n\"That philosophy of intervention changed because of free-market principles, but also because the foreign-exchange markets are so much bigger ... You need a lot more firepower to move a major currency these days,\" says Sean Callow, currency strategist with Westpac in Sydney.\n\nDaily trading in the dollar-yen market is now $568 billion, a 73% increase from when Japan last intervened in 2004, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Around the world, about $4 trillion of currencies change hands overall daily.\n\nThe only other developed country to intervene recently is Switzerland. To fight the euro's fall against the Swiss franc, the Swiss National Bank bought about \u20ac90 billion (about $110.73 billion) before pulling back on serious intervention in June. Despite the intervention, the euro has fallen 12% against the franc this year.\n\nIt isn't clear exactly how much currency Japan injected into currency markets Wednesday, but it will presumably need more than last time.\n\nWhen Japan intervened over a 15-month period to March 2004, it pumped 35 trillion yen into markets, or about $320 billion in 2003 exchange rates. In the end, intervention changed little, with the yen trading roughly where it did at the start of the operation.\n\nHampering its efforts, Japan acted alone on Wednesday, rather than in concert with other central banks.\n\n\"To make this move stick, it needs the U.S. to play, as well as the Chinese,\" says Denis Gould, AXA Investment Managers' director of investment for Asia and Japan. That is unlikely, he says.\n\n\"Nobody will do it in a coordinated manner because nobody wants their currency going up,\" Mr. Gould says. \"Everywhere in the world there are problems with economic growth.\"\n\nThe Group of Seven richest economies, of which Japan is a member, have generally agreed in recent years that direct intervention should be used only to counter alarmingly rapid currency climbs, particularly those stemming from speculative attacks. The yen's recent climb doesn't fit that bill.\n\nThat means that if the Bank of Japan keeps on selling yen on the Ministry of Finance's behalf, U.S. officials and others may start issuing carefully worded criticisms on the Japanese move, making tense international relations on the currency markets even frostier.\n\nSome market watchers say they believe that the intervention, even on this scale, will dodge international criticism, particularly given the yen's surge over recent months to a series of 15-year highs against the dollar. With the Japanese economy looking shaky and exports crucial to its revival, many have seen intervention as the Ministry of Finance's only option, even despite pressure on China to let the yuan rise and fall in line with market forces.\n\nAmong developed economies, Japan is highly reliant on exports to drive its growth and therefore its exchange rate has an outsize impact on the economy there.\n\nBefore 2004, Japan conducted several currency operations to boost its export sector. In April 1995, when the yen hit a high of 79.75 against the dollar, Japan intervened. Within a month the yen had weakened 8% and by the end of 1995 it had weakened 23%. A U.S. economic recovery at the time reinforced the dollar's rebound against the yen.\n\nGovernment intervention in currency markets was a cornerstone of economic policy in the 1980s. Two international pacts, the Plaza Accord and the Louvre Accord, ushered in massive, multilateral currency management to adjust the levels of the dollar and the yen in an attempt to promote stability among the world's largest trading powers.\n\nThe ascendancy of free-market thinking in economic-policy circles led to the promotion of letting exchange rates float free of government intervention.\n\nJapan's move, while unlikely to trigger copycats among major economies, comes amid a pullback from the international consensus that governments shouldn't try to tame capital flows.\n\nThis year, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank separately raised the idea that capital controls are useful for some economies dealing with massive inflows of capital that can lead to asset bubbles and inflation. Such controls could include taxes on investors taking money in or out of a country or minimum periods that investors would be required to keep money in a particular market.\n\n\"There is a significant risk we are going toward a phase in which international trade relationships are going to be a little harder than they used to be. If this is the case, you'll probably have changes in exchange-rate policy around the world and changes in capital controls,\" says Luca Silipo, chief Asia economist for French investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong.\n\nOver the medium term, Japan \"could eventually be successful,\" in weakening the yen, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch currency strategist Tomoko Fujii wrote Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Ms. Fujii warns that another round of money-pumping operations by the Federal Reserve Is likely to send the dollar down against the yen. She maintained her view that the yen will breach its all-time high against the dollar sometime this year.\n\nSome see Japan's unilateral intervention as a lost cause and say that Tokyo should pressure its biggest trading partner to help. China has used its currency reserves to buy $27 billion in Japanese bonds and other securities this year, underpinning the yen's rise, and raising concerns in Japan.\n\n\"Japan should push China to stop buying [Japanese government bonds]\u2014it has a major psychological impact on the market for yen strength,\" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management in Japan. \"That would be a lot more effective than trying to push the forex market.", "abstract": "", "published_on": "2010-09-15 12:45:00", "slug": "japanese-yen-move-bucks-global-trend", "title": "Japan's Yen Move Bucks Global Trend"}}]
